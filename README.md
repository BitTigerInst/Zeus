#Re: AraChat

There're several changes in this project.

- [ ] Rename as Zeus
- [ ] Original goal "A platform that allows users to create highly modular chat applications" will be suspended.
- [ ] New goal is to create a chat app with features __I love__ or it will a plugin, who knows.
- [ ] Angular or React such things are unnecessary until I do need them.

There're several features I'd like to try and implement. (Most related to __Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning__).

- [ ] __Information Transefer__. Automatic transferral to Slack or Email Group, etc.
- [ ] __Useful information extraction__. 

      Since most of the time, conversation in WeChat are causal chatting. Extracting important information can be complementary and useful.
- [ ] __Summaries from different views__. Similar to the last one. 

- [ ] __Fuzzy Search__.

- [ ] __Group Seperation and Integration__.

- [ ] __Integration with Other Apps__. Can make it specified to other fields like Meetup, Project Managment, 3-Min-Video-Show (with Agora), Course/MOOC Selection, O2O, etc.

- [ ] __Doc Share
